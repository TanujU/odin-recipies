    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      It's easy to prep this butter chicken in the slow cooker in the morning to
      come home to the wonderful aroma of warm Indian spices... I love it and
      it's one of my favorite Indian dishes! Serve with basmati rice and warm
      naan bread.

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Heat butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir
        in chicken, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion has softened
        and turned translucent, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato paste, curry paste, curry powder, tandoori masala, and
        garam masala until no lumps of tomato paste remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour mixture into a slow cooker; stir in cardamom pods, coconut milk,
        and yogurt. Season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours or Low for 6 to 8 hours, or until chicken
        is tender and sauce has reduced to the desired consistency. Remove and
        discard cardamom pods before serving.
